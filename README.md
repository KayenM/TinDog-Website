In this day and age there are countless dating apps for humans, but none for dogs??? How can we let this happen, dogs want to find love too!

Here is a fun and exciting website I made for a Tinder for Dogs concept app. I hope you get a good laugh out of it!

This was a front-end design focused project where I really tried to enhance my HTM/CSS skills and become more comfortable with Bootstrap. I also wanted to showcase my UI/UX design skills and gain experience making a website responsive to all screen sizes! I hope you like this!

BTW: if you have a dog and want to feature them in this website let me know!
